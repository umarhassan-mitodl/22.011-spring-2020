Op-Ed Student Examples
----------------------

Students received training on how to write a traditional Op-Ed piece (~750 words) of the kind seen in newspapers. After choosing a topic related to nuclear science and engineering, they prepared a well-researched, one-page technical note (~850 words), and then transformed this technical note into an Op-Ed.
