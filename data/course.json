  "course_description": "In this exploratory seminar, first-year undergraduate students learn the basic physics of nuclear energy and radiation, and learn to communicate their knowledge and perspective by writing a traditional Op-Ed piece. The technical content emphasizes the unique attributes and challenges of nuclear energy as a low-carbon solution as well as the peaceful applications of ionizing radiation to help humankind. The open-ended writing project combines personal creativity and technical knowledge to share important messages about science. The course employs blended learning, as students use the {{% resource_link \"c53db9e0-d641-46f8-a97f-85e9b0b4e394\" \"online course 22.011x\" %}}, freely available on the {{% resource_link \"fe4ae189-7baa-4324-9f05-337ebb999710\" \"MIT Open Learning Library\" %}}, to learn the technical content, and meet together in person for the communication component, developing and polishing their Op-Eds.\n",
